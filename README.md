# stream-clustering-cache
This is the code repository for our paper "Fast Streaming k-Means Clustering with Coreset Caching" which introduces a "coreset caching" technique to provide fast responses to clustering queries.

The run the main program, first change the value of cluster centers ```k``` to expected value and ```d``` to the dimension of the experimental dataset, then call the main program by ```java Main```. The clustering results will be output to text files.
